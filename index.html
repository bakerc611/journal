                <h3>My way late initial journal post</h3>
                <p>I must admit, I have done most of this class in  an extrememly backwards fashion. Thus far, I have run into most of my issues with the immense amount of information there is to remember when it comes to learning this new language. Also, it has really forced me to look at my modus operandi and begin to much more tightly organize and structure my thoughts. I have been blessed to have understanding teachers and extremely helpful classmates. I look forward to the increased intensity as we move forward.

                <p>I have a feeling that page layout is going to be super fun. I really cant wait to give it a try.</p>

                <p>The Cosmological Argument attempts to prove that God exists by showing that there cannot be an infinite number of regressions of causes to things that exist.  It states that there must be a final uncaused-cause of all things.  This uncaused-cause is asserted to be God.
                The Cosmological Argument takes several forms but is basically represented below.

                    <ol>
                        <li>Things exist.</li>
                        <li>It is possible for those things to not exist.</li>
                        <li>Whatever has the possibility of non-existence, yet exists, has been caused to exist.</li>
                        <li>There cannot be an infinite number of causes to bring something into existence.</li>
                        <li>Therefore, there must be an uncaused cause of all things.</li>
                        <li>The uncaused cause must be God.</li>
